# Generation Workflow

Read this reference only for its current stage. Apply the shared runtime, authorization, and routing rules in `../SKILL.md`. All skill-relative paths, including `references/...` and paths using `SKILL_DIR`, refer to the skill root. Generated `qa/...` and `decoded/...` paths refer to the current run directory.

## Brand Discovery

If the user provides only a brand, company, product, or prospect name, perform narrow brand discovery before preparing the pet run. The primary can do this directly; use a scout only when an independent bounded search usefully overlaps other work. The researcher must use web search and prefer official sources such as the brand site, product pages, docs, about pages, press pages, or brand pages. Use reputable secondary sources only when official pages are too thin. Keep the search narrow: enough to extract visual and personality cues, not a market-research brief.

Skip discovery when the user already provides a concrete mascot/avatar description or reference images, unless the user explicitly asks for brand research.

Discovery worker responsibilities:

- search the web for 2-4 relevant sources, preferring official pages
- write an adaptive markdown brief rather than a rigid field dump
- cover identity/category, audience/use context, visual system, personality/tone, product/domain motifs, mascot translation cues, avoidances, and evidence/confidence
- mark mascot guidance that is inferred from sources as inference
- avoid copying logos, readable marks, UI screenshots, slogans, or text
- end with a compact `Generation handoff` section containing only `brand_name`, `brand_brief`, `avatar_seed`, `avoid`, and `brand_sources`
- do not generate images, prepare run folders, or edit unrelated files

Use this discovery worker prompt:

```text
Research a brand for hatch-pet mascot creation.

Brand/product/prospect: <brand name>
User context: <short user request>
Output file: <absolute path to brand-discovery.md>

Use web search. Prefer official brand, product, docs, about, press, or brand pages. Use reputable secondary sources only if official sources are too thin. Write an adaptive markdown brief to the output file. Headings may flex by brand, but the brief must cover:
- identity/category: canonical name, product type, what it does
- audience/use context: who it serves and where it appears
- visual system: palette, shapes, line quality, materials, typography feel, iconography, patterns
- personality/tone: emotional traits, energy, formality, playfulness
- product/domain motifs: objects, workflows, verbs, metaphors, environments
- mascot translation cues: candidate forms, signature traits, props, what must read at pet size
- avoidances: logos/text, trademark-sensitive elements, misleading cues, competitor confusion, poor mascot fits
- evidence/confidence: source URLs plus notes where evidence is weak or inferred

Do not copy logos, readable marks, UI screenshots, slogans, or text. Clearly label mascot guidance that is inferred rather than directly sourced.

End the brief with a `Generation handoff` section containing exactly:
- brand_name=<canonical brand/product name>
- brand_brief=<one sentence, max 45 words, covering palette/tone/domain motifs/personality>
- avatar_seed=<short mascot-safe visual idea, no logo copying>
- avoid=<short comma-separated list>
- brand_sources=<comma-separated source URLs>

Return exactly:
brand_discovery_file=<absolute output file path>
brand_name=<canonical brand/product name>
brand_brief=<same compact sentence from Generation handoff>
avatar_seed=<same short seed from Generation handoff>
avoid=<same short avoid list from Generation handoff>
brand_sources=<same comma-separated URLs from Generation handoff>
```

The parent should save the markdown brief before preparing the run, then pass it to `prepare_pet_run.py` as `--brand-discovery-file` together with `--brand-name`, `--brand-brief`, repeated `--brand-source`, and a concise `--pet-notes` value based on `avatar_seed` when the user did not provide a better avatar description. Keep the full brief for review; only the compact handoff fields should shape prompts. If web search is unavailable and the user gave only a bare brand name, ask for brand cues before generating.

## Generation Contract

### Visual Job Graph

Expect up to 13 visual jobs: 1 base pet, 9 standard row strips, 1 required four-cardinal anchor strip, and 2 required coherent look-direction row strips. The standard states are `idle`, `running-right`, `running-left`, `waving`, `jumping`, `failed`, `waiting`, `running`, and `review`. The only deterministic visual derivation is `running-left`, which may be produced by mirroring `running-right` only after `running-right` has been generated, visually inspected, and explicitly approved as safe to mirror. If mirroring is not appropriate, generate `running-left` as a normal grounded `$imagegen` row.

### Look Direction Sequence

After validating rows 0–8, write qa/look-mechanics.md, then generate and approve one four-pose cardinal strip in this fixed order: 000 up, 090 screen-right, 180 down, and 270 screen-left. Generate row 9 as one coherent eight-pose family from those approved cardinal pose families, interpolating the intermediate directions as even 22.5-degree steps. Deterministically register its eight ordered pose groups, then run final-cell edge, semantic, and continuity QA immediately. Only after row 9 passes, generate row 10 as one coherent eight-pose family, using the approved cardinals for direction meaning and completed row 9 for identity, scale, registration, and boundary continuity. Run the same QA immediately after row 10. Row 9 contains 000, 022.5, 045, 067.5, 090, 112.5, 135, and 157.5; row 10 contains 180, 202.5, 225, 247.5, 270, 292.5, 315, and 337.5. 000 means up, not neutral/front. Never ask $imagegen to generate or repair a complete 8×11 atlas.

### Visual Provenance And Grounding

After selecting a visual output, the parent agent copies that exact image into the job's `decoded/` path, runs its required incremental checks, and only then marks the job complete in `imagegen-jobs.json`. Do not write helper scripts that populate row outputs. The deterministic Python scripts may only process already-generated visual outputs.

Only the base job may be prompt-only. Every row-strip job generated through `$imagegen` must use the input images listed in `imagegen-jobs.json`, including the canonical base reference created after the selected base output is copied. Treat any row generation without attached grounding images as invalid.

## Pet-Safe Styles

Default style is `auto`: infer the pet's style from the user's prompt and references, then preserve that style across every row. If the user names a style, honor it. Supported style presets include `pixel`, `plush`, `clay`, `sticker`, `flat-vector`, `3d-toy`, `painterly`, `brand-inspired`, and `auto`.

Any style is acceptable when it remains pet-safe:

- compact whole-body silhouette readable inside a `192x208` cell
- consistent face, proportions, material, palette, and props across all rows
- clean removable chroma-key background
- details large enough to read at pet size
- no text, labels, UI, or readable logos unless the user explicitly provides approved reference art and asks for them

Non-pixel styles are first-class. Plush, clay, sticker, vector, 3D toy, painterly mascot, ink, and brand-inspired looks should be accepted when they satisfy the atlas and readability constraints.

## Transparency And Effects

Pet rows are processed into transparent `192x208` cells, so every generated pixel must either belong to the pet sprite or be cleanly removable chroma-key background. Prefer pose, expression, and silhouette changes over decorative effects.

The deterministic raster pipeline owns the transparency and chroma-cleanup invariants. Its final edge-local spill-suppression step selects every translucent silhouette-boundary pixel plus opaque boundary pixels whose chroma points toward the known key, then extends clean interior RGB outward through that band in linear light. It preserves alpha exactly, clears hidden RGB under fully transparent pixels, and reports the algorithm and parameters used. The cleanup report plus atlas validator are authoritative for chroma contamination. Once the final report has `ok: true` and atlas validation passes, do not regenerate imagery or add another chroma-cleanup pass.

Fully transparent pixels are allowed outside the sprite silhouette, in unused cells, and in intentional negative-space openings that are part of the pet's design, such as loops or holes in a ribbon body. Reject any generated or repaired cell with accidental 100%-transparent holes inside a filled body, including horizontal bands, seam rows, scanline-like gaps, sliced-tile boundaries, or "see-through" interior stripes. Inspect suspect cells on a high-contrast background or alpha mask before accepting them; ordinary atlas validation is not enough when the hole is inside the silhouette.

Allowed effects must satisfy all of these conditions:

- The effect is state-relevant and helps explain the animation.
- The effect is physically attached to, touching, or overlapping the pet silhouette, not floating nearby.
- The effect is inside the same frame slot as the pet and does not create a separate sprite component.
- The effect is opaque, hard-edged enough for clean extraction, and uses non-chroma-key colors.
- The effect is small enough to remain readable at `192x208` without clutter.

Avoid these by default because they usually break transparent-background cleanup or component extraction:

- wave marks, motion arcs, speed lines, action streaks, afterimages, blur, or smears
- detached stars, loose sparkles, floating punctuation, floating icons, falling tear drops, separated smoke clouds, or loose dust
- cast shadows, contact shadows, drop shadows, oval floor shadows, floor patches, landing marks, impact bursts, glow, halo, aura, or soft transparent effects
- text, labels, frame numbers, visible grids, guide marks, speech bubbles, thought bubbles, UI panels, code snippets, checkerboard transparency, white backgrounds, black backgrounds, or scenery
- chroma-key-adjacent colors in the pet, prop, effects, highlights, or shadows
- stray pixels, disconnected outline bits, speckle/noise, cropped body parts, overlapping poses, or any pose that crosses into a neighboring frame slot

State-specific guidance:

- `idle`: keep this calm and low-distraction. Use only subtle breathing, a tiny blink, a slight head or body bob, a very small material sway, or another quiet persona-preserving motion. The loop must still contain visible micro-variation; do not accept six effectively identical copies. Do not show waving, walking, running, jumping, talking, working, reviewing, emotional reactions, large gestures, item interactions, or new props.
- `waving`: show the wave through paw, hand, wing, or limb pose only. Do not draw wave marks, motion arcs, lines, sparkles, symbols, or floating effects around the gesture.
- `jumping`: show vertical motion through body position only. Do not draw shadows, dust, landing marks, impact bursts, bounce pads, or floor cues.
- `failed`: tears, attached smoke puffs, or attached stars are allowed if they obey the allowed-effects rules; do not use red X marks, floating symbols, detached smoke, detached stars, or separate tear droplets.
- `waiting`: show that Codex needs approval, help, or user input through an expectant asking pose. Keep it distinct from ordinary idle and review.
- `running`: show active task work, processing, thinking, scanning, typing, or focused effort. Do not show literal foot-running, jogging, sprinting, treadmill motion, raised knees, long steps, pumping arms, directional travel, speed lines, dust clouds, floor shadows, motion trails, or detached motion effects.
- `review`: show focus through lean, blink, eyes, head tilt, or paw/hand position. Do not add magnifying glasses, papers, code, UI, punctuation, symbols, or other new props unless they already exist in the base pet identity.
- `running-right` and `running-left`: show directional drag movement through body, limb, and prop movement only. `running-right` must face and travel right; `running-left` must face and travel left. Their cadence must visibly alternate across the loop rather than repeating one nearly static stride. Do not draw speed lines, dust clouds, floor shadows, motion trails, or detached motion effects.

## Visible Progress Plan

For every pet run, keep a visible checklist so the user can see where the work is up to. Create the checklist before starting, keep one step active at a time, and update it as each step finishes.

Use this checklist for every v2 pet run, replacing `<Pet>` with the pet's name or `your pet`:

1. Getting `<Pet>` ready.
2. Imagining `<Pet>`'s main look.
3. Picturing `<Pet>`'s poses.
4. Hatching `<Pet>`.

What each step means:

- `Getting <Pet> ready.` Choose or confirm the pet name, description, source images, style preset, style notes, and working folder. For bare brand/product/company requests, first perform brand discovery and capture the compact brand brief, source URLs, and avatar seed.
- `Imagining <Pet>'s main look.` Generate the pet's main reference image. This becomes the visual source of truth.
- `Picturing <Pet>'s poses.` Generate and approve rows `0-8`, write the pet-specific look mechanics plan, then generate rows `9-10`. Only mirror `running-left` if `running-right` clearly works when flipped.
- `Hatching <Pet>.` Assemble the 8x11 atlas, review standard motion plus all 16 look directions, fix every failed cell or row, package `spriteVersionNumber: 2`, and report the output paths.

Only mark a step complete when the real file, image, or decision exists. If this is a repair run, start from the first relevant step instead of restarting the whole checklist.

## Time Budget And Convergence

Aim to complete a normal pet run within 30 minutes while preserving every mandatory acceptance criterion. Treat this as a planning target and an incentive to maximize validated progress per minute, not as permission to weaken QA or package a failing pet.

At the start of the run, allocate an approximate budget:

- preparation: 2 minutes
- base image: 3 minutes
- standard rows: 10 minutes
- look directions: 8 minutes
- final QA and packaging: 5 minutes
- buffer: 2 minutes

Run independent generation jobs concurrently up to the worker limit, start deterministic checks as soon as each dependency is ready, and record actual stage plus repair time. Prefer character and prop constructions that naturally satisfy cell geometry, transparency, component connectivity, and direction semantics; identify likely conflicts such as open interior gaps, detached parts, thin connectors, asymmetric props, or ambiguous faces before row generation.

After every failed attempt:

1. Classify the failure as visual semantics, identity, source-edge geometry, component connectivity, extraction, chroma, continuity, or final visual QA.
2. State the concrete evidence and the root condition the next action will change.
3. Use a deterministic correction for deterministic failures before regenerating imagery.
4. Regenerate only when the source visual is genuinely wrong, and preserve every property that already passed.
5. Compare the new result with the previous one. A repair counts as progress only when it reduces the number or severity of failures without breaking a previously passing gate.

If the same root failure recurs twice, stop varying the prompt and change strategy: strengthen the cardinal pose families or row-level direction instructions, simplify the pose or prop construction, change the deterministic extraction method, or redesign the problematic visual feature. If a repair merely moves a failure to another cell or gate, treat that as a cycle and change strategy immediately.

Use elapsed-time checkpoints:

- At 15 minutes, verify the run is on pace and that the remaining dependency path is bounded.
- At 25 minutes, prioritize the shortest quality-preserving path through remaining blockers and avoid optional polish.
- At 30 minutes, continue only when the remaining work is clearly converging and bounded, such as final validation, one targeted repair, or packaging.
- Keep recording elapsed time, retries, validation failures, and QA cost throughout the run, but do not pause or stop solely because elapsed time crosses 45 or 60 minutes. Continue until the pet passes, the user cancels, or a genuine external blocker prevents further progress.

Never use the time target to skip blind direction QA, labeled semantics, continuity review, atlas validation, despill validation, final visual QA, or any other acceptance criterion.

## Default Workflow

1. Prepare a pet run folder and imagegen job manifest:

```bash
SKILL_DIR="${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}/skills/hatch-pet"
"$PYTHON" "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/prepare_pet_run.py" \
  --pet-name "<Name>" \
  --description "<one sentence>" \
  --reference /absolute/path/to/reference.png \
  --output-dir /absolute/path/to/run \
  --pet-notes "<stable pet description>" \
  --brand-discovery-file /absolute/path/to/brand-discovery.md \
  --brand-name "<optional researched brand name>" \
  --brand-brief "<optional compact researched brand cue sentence>" \
  --brand-source "https://example.com/source" \
  --style-preset auto \
  --style-notes "<optional freeform style notes>" \
  --force
```

All arguments above are optional except any flags needed to express user constraints. For text-only requests, pass the concept through `--pet-notes` and omit `--reference`; `prepare_pet_run.py` will infer a name, description, chroma key, and output directory as needed.
For brand-only requests, perform the discovery step first, save the markdown brief, then pass the brief path through `--brand-discovery-file`, `avatar_seed` through `--pet-notes`, `brand_name` through `--brand-name`, `brand_brief` through `--brand-brief`, and each source URL through repeated `--brand-source`.

2. Inspect `imagegen-jobs.json` for the next ready `$imagegen` jobs. A job is ready when its `status` is not `complete` and every id in `depends_on` is already complete. Prefer reading the manifest directly with `jq` or the editor instead of adding helper scripts for status display:

```bash
jq '.jobs[] | {id, kind, status, depends_on, prompt_file, retry_prompt_file, input_images, output_path, derivation_policy}' /absolute/path/to/run/imagegen-jobs.json
```

3. Generate visual jobs with lightweight workers by default:

- Generate and copy `base` first, using a lightweight base worker.
- Generate and copy `idle` and `running-right` next as the identity and gait check, using one lightweight worker per row.
- Inspect `running-right`; mirror `running-left` only when visual identity, prop placement, markings, lighting, and direction semantics remain correct.
- Generate `running-left` normally with a lightweight worker when mirroring would change meaning or identity.
- Generate the remaining rows with lightweight workers, using every input image listed for each job.
- After standard-row QA, generate `look-cardinals` as one four-pose strip, extract it into `decoded/look-anchors/000.png`, `090.png`, `180.png`, and `270.png`, and approve all four. The `090` and `270` anchors must be unmistakable in viewer/screen coordinates and visibly oppose each other.
- Generate look row 9 as one coherent eight-pose synthesis from the approved cardinal strip, interpolating each intermediate direction as an even step between the adjacent cardinal pose families. Deterministically recover the eight ordered pose groups, crop them, normalize them with one shared scale and baseline, and then run final-cell edge diagnostics plus labeled per-direction QA immediately, before row 10 or final atlas assembly.
- Only after row 9 passes, generate row 10 as one coherent synthesis using the approved cardinal strip and completed row 9.

Use at most the smaller of three, the active child-agent limit, and the number of independent ready jobs. With a child limit of one, run jobs sequentially. Never increase the configured limit for this workflow, and keep shared manifest updates with one writer.

For each ready visual job, invoke `$imagegen` with the prompt file listed in `imagegen-jobs.json`, every listed input image with its role label, and the default built-in `image_gen` path unless `$imagegen` itself routes otherwise. The parent agent must keep its own image handling minimal: do not open every generated base or row in the parent rollout. Workers return only the selected source path and a one-sentence QA note; the parent records the selected source path in the manifest.

`prepare_pet_run.py` creates matching layout guides under `references/layout-guides/` for the nine standard rows, two look rows, and four-cardinal strip, and both look rows. Visual jobs attach the matching guide as a layout-only input so the model can follow the correct frame count, spacing, centering, and safe padding. Treat these guides as invisible construction references: generated strips must not include visible boxes, borders, center marks, labels, guide colors, or the guide background.

When generating row strips, keep the identity lock in the row prompt authoritative. Preserve the same style, face, markings, palette, materials, prop design, body proportions, and silhouette from the canonical base. Row jobs attach the layout guide and canonical base by default; the decoded base is kept in the run folder for deterministic processing rather than sent as a redundant generation input.

If `$imagegen` returns a transport-level `Bad Request` for a row, retry that same row once with its generated `retry_prompt_file`. The retry prompt preserves the row id, frame count, chroma key, canonical-base identity, and state action. Keep the canonical base attached. If the retry still fails, stop and report the failing row and prompt paths instead of switching to any other generation path.

4. After selecting a generated output for a job, copy it into the decoded output path. For `base`, also create the canonical identity reference:

```bash
RUN_DIR=/absolute/path/to/run
JOB_ID=<job-id>
SOURCE=/absolute/path/to/generated-output.png
OUTPUT_REL=$(jq -r --arg id "$JOB_ID" '.jobs[] | select(.id == $id) | .output_path' "$RUN_DIR/imagegen-jobs.json")
mkdir -p "$(dirname "$RUN_DIR/$OUTPUT_REL")"
cp "$SOURCE" "$RUN_DIR/$OUTPUT_REL"
```

```bash
if [ "$JOB_ID" = "base" ]; then mkdir -p "$RUN_DIR/references"; cp "$RUN_DIR/$OUTPUT_REL" "$RUN_DIR/references/canonical-base.png"; fi
```

For every standard `row-strip` job, immediately extract and inspect only that row before marking the job complete. This overlaps deterministic QA and any repair with generation of other ready rows instead of waiting for all nine rows:

```bash
ROW_QA_DIR="$RUN_DIR/qa/rows/$JOB_ID"
"$PYTHON" "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/extract_strip_frames.py" \
  --decoded-dir "$RUN_DIR/decoded" \
  --output-dir "$ROW_QA_DIR/frames" \
  --states "$JOB_ID" \
  --method auto
"$PYTHON" "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/inspect_frames.py" \
  --frames-root "$ROW_QA_DIR/frames" \
  --json-out "$ROW_QA_DIR/review.json" \
  --states "$JOB_ID" \
  --require-components
```

Treat errors as an immediate repair request. Inspect warnings before accepting the row; do not defer a known clipping, component, or extraction problem to final atlas QA. Chroma cleanup belongs to the deterministic post-assembly despill pass and must not trigger row regeneration. If the only failure is component extraction and the source strip itself has stable scale and placement, use the existing `stable-slots` correction with `--allow-stable-slots` instead of regenerating imagery.

For `look-cardinals`, extract and validate all four anchors before marking the job complete:

```bash
CHROMA_KEY=$(jq -r '.chroma_key.hex' "$RUN_DIR/pet_request.json")
"$PYTHON" "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/extract_cardinal_anchors.py" \
  --strip "$RUN_DIR/decoded/look-cardinals.png" \
  --output-dir "$RUN_DIR/decoded/look-anchors" \
  --chroma-key "$CHROMA_KEY" \
  --json-out "$RUN_DIR/qa/cardinal-anchors.json"
"$PYTHON" "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/compose_cardinal_anchor_strip.py" \
  --anchors-dir "$RUN_DIR/decoded/look-anchors" \
  --output "$RUN_DIR/decoded/look-anchors-approved.png"
```

Approve the four extracted anchors semantically at final pet size. If one cardinal fails, regenerate that individual anchor with `prompts/look-anchor-repairs/<degree>.md`, replace only its extracted file, and rerun `compose_cardinal_anchor_strip.py`. Both final look rows use the approved cardinal strip, and row 10 additionally uses completed row 9. Mark the job complete only after its required deterministic and visual checks pass:

```bash
UPDATED_AT=$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)
TMP_MANIFEST=$(mktemp)
jq --arg id "$JOB_ID" --arg source "$SOURCE" --arg at "$UPDATED_AT" '(.jobs[] | select(.id == $id)) += {status: "complete", source_path: $source, completed_at: $at}' "$RUN_DIR/imagegen-jobs.json" > "$TMP_MANIFEST"
mv "$TMP_MANIFEST" "$RUN_DIR/imagegen-jobs.json"
```

After `decoded/look-anchors-approved.png` exists and all four cardinals have passed semantic review, mark `look-cardinals` complete. Row 9 then becomes ready immediately.

If the copied source is under `${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}/generated_images`, delete the original generated file after the decoded copy exists:

```bash
GENERATED_ROOT="${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}/generated_images"
case "$SOURCE" in
  "$GENERATED_ROOT"/*)
    rm -f "$SOURCE"
    rmdir "$(dirname "$SOURCE")" 2>/dev/null || true
    ;;
esac
```

5. Derive `running-left` only when it is visually safe:

```bash
"$PYTHON" "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/derive_running_left_from_running_right.py" \
  --run-dir /absolute/path/to/run \
  --confirm-appropriate-mirror \
  --decision-note "<why mirroring preserves this pet's identity>"
```

That script mirrors each generated frame slot in place so the leftward row preserves the rightward row's temporal order. Do not replace it with a whole-strip mirror that reverses animation timing.

6. When all nine incrementally validated standard row jobs are complete, build and review the intermediate rows `0-8`:

```bash
RUN_DIR=/absolute/path/to/run
mkdir -p "$RUN_DIR/final" "$RUN_DIR/qa"
```

```bash
"$PYTHON" "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/extract_strip_frames.py" \
  --decoded-dir "$RUN_DIR/decoded" \
  --output-dir "$RUN_DIR/frames" \
  --states all \
  --method auto
```

```bash
"$PYTHON" "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/inspect_frames.py" \
  --frames-root "$RUN_DIR/frames" \
  --json-out "$RUN_DIR/qa/review.json" \
  --require-components
```

```bash
"$PYTHON" "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/compose_atlas.py" \
  --frames-root "$RUN_DIR/frames" \
  --output "$RUN_DIR/final/spritesheet.png" \
  --webp-output "$RUN_DIR/final/spritesheet.webp"
```

```bash
"$PYTHON" "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/make_contact_sheet.py" \
  "$RUN_DIR/final/spritesheet.webp" \
  --output "$RUN_DIR/qa/contact-sheet.png"
```

```bash
"$PYTHON" "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/render_animation_previews.py" \
  --frames-root "$RUN_DIR/frames" \
  --output-dir "$RUN_DIR/qa/previews"
```

If the preview GIFs show size popping or baseline jumps caused by per-frame fit-to-cell extraction, and the original row strip itself had stable scale and placement, rerun frame extraction with the explicit row-stability mode and then re-run inspection, atlas composition, contact sheet generation, and previews:

```bash
"$PYTHON" "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/extract_strip_frames.py" \
  --decoded-dir "$RUN_DIR/decoded" \
  --output-dir "$RUN_DIR/frames" \
  --states all \
  --method stable-slots
```

```bash
"$PYTHON" "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/inspect_frames.py" \
  --frames-root "$RUN_DIR/frames" \
  --json-out "$RUN_DIR/qa/review.json" \
  --require-components \
  --allow-stable-slots
```

Use `stable-slots` as a deliberate QA-driven correction, not the default. It should reduce extraction-induced motion pops without hiding clipped wide poses or bad source strips.

Expected intermediate output before the required v2 look stage:

```text
run/
  pet_request.json
  imagegen-jobs.json
  prompts/
  decoded/
  frames/frames-manifest.json
  final/spritesheet.webp
  qa/contact-sheet.png
  qa/previews/*.gif
  qa/review.json
```

Inspect `qa/contact-sheet.png` and `qa/previews/*.gif` before generating look rows. `qa/review.json` plus visual motion review are the intermediate gates. The standard contact sheet intentionally predates chroma cleanup, so visible key-color fringe there is not a failure; judge chroma only on the cleaned final v2 atlas. Block progress if any standard row changes identity, style, prop handedness, or silhouette, or if playback pops, reverses cadence, faces the wrong direction, or is visually inert. Do not package or clean up yet.
